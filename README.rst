Jupyter Notebook Example
========================

Example for a Jupyter Notebook.

Features
--------

Usage
-----

While the project consists of Python code and Jinja2 templates it is prepared
to be used through `Cookiecutter`_.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Cookiecutter`_ is required to make use of this template. It can be acquired
through pip:

``$ pip install cookiecutter``

Of course, a Python interpreter is also required. To find the valid versions
check the Cookiecutter page.

All other dependencies are indicated on the requirements.txt file.

These can be installed with:

``$ pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt``

Installing and creating a new project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The template can be used from the command line with the following command:

``$ cookiecutter gh:bernardo-mg/cookiecutter-python-library``

This will download the template and begin to create a new project. After this
the template has been installed on the local computer, and can be reused with
the following command:

``$ cookiecutter cookiecutter-python-library/``

Collaborate
-----------

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

Issues management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues are managed at the GitHub `project issues tracker`_, where any Github
user may report bugs or ask for new features.

Getting the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the `GitHub project page`_, where
the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest
release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
